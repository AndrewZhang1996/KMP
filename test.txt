Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Friday urged the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member countries to enhance cooperation in security, trade liberalization and inter-connectivity, so as to maintain stability and promote growth in the region. 

Addressing the prime ministers' meeting in Russia's coastal city of Sochi, Li proposed that the SCO member countries should approve an anti-extremism treaty at an early date to better safeguard the region. 

"The SCO members should speed up the process in their respective countries to have the document approved and taken effect as soon as possible," Li said. 

The SCO anti-extremism treaty was signed by eight member countries in June's Astana summit in Kazakhstan, but it will come into force with approvals in the member countries, namely China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. 

Security is the basic foundation for development, Li said, calling for further regional security cooperation under the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. 

In order to prevent the backflow of terror groups, the SCO members should promote security cooperative mechanism, and deepen cooperation in the fields of information exchanges, training and security protection in large-scale events, Li said. 

He also suggested the establishment of a regional center to address security challenges and threats, and to augment cooperation in drug control and fighting cross-border crimes. 

The two-day SCO meeting among heads of government is the first of its kind after the organization's membership expansion in June to include India and Pakistan. 

In the face of an improving world economic and global trade, Li proposed that the SCO members should further promote trade liberalization and facilitation. 

China "proposes to accelerate consultations on signing a SCO agreement on trade facilitation, conduct a feasibility study of the SCO Free Trade Area in due course, and gradually establish institutional arrangements for regional economic cooperation," Li said. 

The premier called on the SCO members to support cross-border e-commerce development and strengthen service trade among themselves. 

Meanwhile, Li called for better and faster strategic alignments among the SCO members, saying China is willing to jointly handle challenges and promote regional stability and prosperity with other countries. 

From theory and planning to practical implementations, cooperation in strategic alignments between China and other SCO members has come to a new stage, Li said. 

Development is regarded as an effective way to settle regional conflicts and instability, Li said, adding that the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is a platform for practical cooperation instead of a geopolitical tool. 

Besides, Li called for joint efforts to accelerate the process of regional connectivity by promoting integration in planning and technical standard systems to raise efficiency in transportation industry. 

He urged the members to advance regional infrastructure construction in such fields as transportation, energy, information and communication networks. 

Li also proposed to boost cooperation in industrial production capacity, investment facilitation, and between the SCO members in the industries of clean energy, green economy, geoscience and aerospace. 

Furthermore, Li encouraged the member countries to consolidate people-to-people exchanges and continuously promote communications and cooperation in education, culture, science and technology, healthcare, environmental protection, tourism and the younger generations. 

Prime ministers and government representatives from the SCO member countries also participated in the conference. They spoke highly of the good momentum and great potential for development of the organization. 

They said regional security and economic development are in line with the common interests of all member countries. 

Under the "Shanghai Spirit" featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for cultural diversity and pursuit of common development, the SCO members should strengthen strategic alignments, and push forward inter-connectivity and regional trade integration, they said. 

They pledged to offer supportive policies to enterprises and help them participate in regional economic cooperation.

Tensions escalated after North Korea launched a new Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the US mainland. The US is threatening extreme sanctions such as curbing oil supplies and is pushing for other countries to sever ties with Pyongyang. 

The pressure for the US to slap extreme sanctions on North Korea falls once again on China and the risk of war is rising. 

China will face difficult choices, but at least we can say China has tried its best. We can neither persuade Pyongyang nor sway the opinion of Washington. The only thing China can do next is to firmly uphold its principles, strive to alleviate tensions while at the same time preparing for the worst. 

China has done what it can for North Korea. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program caused geopolitical instability in Northeast Asia, increasing challenges to China's own security. The US found a new excuse to deploy its strategic military weapons to the region. The THAAD system poses a direct threat to China. 

China remains one of a few countries that still pursue a friendly policy toward North Korea. Although China participated in the UN Security Council sanctions, the country remains the largest trading partner of North Korea. China has in several UN Security Council debates strongly opposed a comprehensive trade embargo against Pyongyang, stressing that sanctions should only be geared toward fields related to the nuclear program but not to hurt ordinary North Korean people's livelihoods. 

China has done what it can for the US. The source of this nuclear crisis is the escalating hostility between Pyongyang and Washington. The theory that China should be held responsible is wrong in logic. To solve the nuclear crisis, one must work simultaneously on sanctions and negotiations. China has fulfilled its obligations in complying with UN Security Council sanctions, suffering a loss in Sino-North Korean relations. On the other hand, the US and South Korea failed to fulfill their obligations in alleviating tensions and pushing for talks. They have instead pinned their hopes on China. 

For a period of time, the US has been threatening China to increase sanctions against North Korea. Beijing has been working with Washington with the greatest patience possible. China has played a critical role in preventing the situation from collapsing into confrontation between the US and North Korea. With increasing US pressure on Pyongyang, China has suffered the greatest loss. 

When tensions on the Korean Peninsula reach a new height, a large portion of the pressure is transferred to China. But the US and North Korea must shoulder their own responsibility without making China the scapegoat. 

North Korea should be prepared to face further sanctions as it violated the UN Security Council resolutions to continue testing missiles. China has no reason to pay for North Korea's mistakes. 

Whatever North Korea did, it is wrong to impose a full trade embargo or to sever ties with the country. China has no obligation to cooperate with the US on this impractical idea. The US has no right to direct China or the UN Security Council. 

Recently the US media began to recognize China's efforts, acknowledging that China cannot stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. We believe that Pyongyang is beginning to recognize too that when it continues to test missiles and nuclear weapons, China cannot stop it from being punished.

The possibility of a war on the Korean Peninsula is rising and it is not decided by China. China's strategy should be maintaining its independent stance and principles, pushing the UN Security Council to craft the most reasonable policy and refusing to yield to either sides' extreme requests, be they from Washington or Pyongyang. 

China will face whatever comes next. Beijing is fully prepared to use its prowess to defend its national interest. China owes no one anything, and other countries must know this.

Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez said Friday that his country aims to sign a comprehensive cooperation agreement with China in 2018, along with other members of Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). 

"We aim to agree on a joint plan of action for cooperation," Vazquez said at the opening of the 11th China-Latin America and the Caribbean (China-LAC) Business Summit in Punta del Este, Uruguay. 

Vazquez said he received an "interesting proposal from China" with "bold" ideas, such as creating a free trade zone between CELAC and China, stepping up financial cooperation and developing infrastructure. 

Vazquez acknowledged there are "several hurdles and geographic distances that we must overcome to optimize this partnership and continue making progress in ties with China," which he described as the "champion of international trade and engine of global commerce." 

Uruguayan Foreign Affairs Minister Rodolfo Nin Novoa also underscored his country's ties with China, and its agricultural sector's role in supplying the Chinese market. 

"We want to contribute to China's food security. Uruguay is home to 3 million inhabitants and produces food for 30 to 35 million people," said Novoa. 

"We are interested in partnering with the 'new normal' China," said Novoa, referring to the Asian giant's transition from an export-driven economy to a consumer-driven economy. 

"Uruguay has strengths in many areas. We want to be allies, with an emphasis on joint development projects in the field of agriculture," said Novoa. 

China is Uruguay's leading trade partner, with bilateral trade standing at some 3.373 billion US dollars, accounting for 20 percent of the South American country's total international trade in goods. 

Bilateral trade grew 19 percent in the first nine months of the year, reaching 3.250 billion dollars, and Uruguay's exports to China have grown 22 percent a year on average in the past decade, according to Uruguay's export promotion agency Uruguay XXI. 

The two-day China-LAC business summit helped lay the groundwork for next year's ministerial meeting of CELAC, which is a regional bloc of 33 countries with a population of some 600 million. 

The bloc seeks to deepen political, economic, social and cultural integration in Latin America and the Caribbean, and reduce the influence of the United States in the region.

China hopes to see the world moving towards a community with a shared future, Chinese congresswoman and senior diplomat Fu Ying said at the Third Mediterranean Dialogue forum being held in Rome from Thursday to Saturday. 

The world should have a common roof for all, and to share not to divide, said Fu Ying, chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (China's top legislature). 

Talking about China's policy and stance in the context of globalization, Fu said it's widely believed in China that the most important driving force for economic growth in the first quarter of century after the Cold War has been economic globalization. 

"The world economy has expanded more than three times, lifting many people out of poverty. Such an unprecedented wealth increase would not have been possible without economic globalization," she said. 

According to Fu, the developed countries which were the first mover of globalization have gained huge benefit from it, while many developing countries have also seized the opportunity, and China is a successful example. 

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), through painstaking reform and opening-up and with the Chinese people's dedicated efforts, China has grown into the second largest economy and people's living standard has significantly risen, Fu said. 

"However, globalization is also criticized for its flaws and since the 2008 financial crisis, global wealth and trade has been shrinking and voices against globalization have grown louder. But we don't think turning-back is an option," she pointed out. 

"In our view, the problem does not lie with globalization itself but the way it's pursued in some aspects and its inadequate management. Global governance has not kept pace and the current international order and institutions are not coping with the new and diverse global challenges effectively," she said. 

Globalization in other fields is perceived with mixed feeling, Fu noticed. "But after 20 years, I guess most of us now agree that the attempt to transform the world with Western values and political system is far from achieving all of its purposes, and new problems are added to old woes," she said. 

The negative result is still haunting some countries, leaving many people and families displaced, added Fu, China's former deputy minister of foreign affairs. 

Fu also cited an ancient Chinese saying: "Sweet oranges grown in the south would taste sour once transplanted to the north. The orange trees may still look the same, yet the soil and climate conditions have changed." 

"This wise teaching that has come down in history reminds us of the importance to respect differences not to impose on others," said the former Chinese ambassador to Britain.

The document, which plays an exemplary role for international anti-extremism cooperation, shows the region's decisive resolution in the fight against the "three evil forces," namely terrorism, extremism and separatism, Li said. 

Security is the basic foundation for development and meets the expectations of people, Li said, calling for further regional security cooperation under the common, all-round, cooperative and sustainable security concept. 

In order to prevent the backflow of terror groups, the SCO members should promote security cooperative mechanism, deepen cooperation in the fields of information exchanges, training and security protection in large-scale events, Li said.

The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), one of China's eight non-communist political parties, will elect a new leadership during its 12th National Congress, which opened here on Friday. 

Vice Premier Wang Yang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met congress delegates and delivered a congratulatory message to the association at the opening session on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. 

Over the past five years, the CAPD has performed its role in multi-party cooperation, said Wang, praising its contributions to promoting reform and opening and socialist modernization. 

The CPC will uphold and improve the system of CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation, he said. 

In handling its relationships with other political parties, the CPC will adhere to the principle of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, treating each other with sincerity and sharing of both good and bad times, according to Wang. 

Wang said the CPC will support these parties in performing their duties in line with the requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics for their participation in governance, and consolidate and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front. 

Wang appealed to the CAPD members to learn and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. 

CAPD chairwoman Yan Junqi delivered a report on the party's work over the past five years. 

Yan said the CAPD will study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, and carry out its duties as a participant party. 

She said the CAPD will contribute more wisdom to completing the building of a moderately prosperous society, the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. 

A new party central committee will be elected at the congress. 

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Friday congratulated the CAPD on the opening of its national congress. 

As a time-tested intimate partner with the CPC and one of the participating parties in building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, the CAPD has played an important role during the country's process of standing up, growing rich and becoming strong, says the congratulatory message. 

The CAPD is also an important force in securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, accomplishing Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, as well as realizing the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, says the message. 

The CAPD has provided valuable suggestions over the past five years on issues including the balanced development of compulsory education, to boosting the manufacturing industry via the reform of vocational education, and establishing a modern public cultural service system, the message says. 

The Central Committee of the CPC will continue to follow the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and insist on the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC, it continues. 

In the meantime, the CAPD is encouraged to follow major tasks raised at the 19th CPC National Congress and give full play to its strength in the development of education and the building of China into an innovative country. 

Founded in 1945, the CAPD membership mainly consists of intellectuals working in the fields of culture, education, publishing and science.

The possibilities of military clashes on the Korean Peninsula remain high as the US is trying to forge a united global political and military front to pressure North Korea, including sending its strongest planes to military drills with South Korea, Chinese experts said on Friday.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump on Thursday held their second phone talks in two days after Pyongyang's latest long-range missile test, agreeing to keep up the pressure and sanctions in hope of bringing the regime back to the negotiating table, the Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday.

"The two leaders agreed on the need to maintain their basic stance of putting strong sanctions and pressure on the North until North Korea voluntarily gives up developing nukes and missiles and comes out for dialogue," South Korea's presidential office Blue House said in a statement on Friday, Yonhap reported.

Chinese President Xi Jinping talked with Trump on the phone on Wednesday, saying the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China's unswerving goal, the Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily press briefing on Friday that China's stance on the North Korea nuclear issue is clear and has maintained communication with the US.

"China and the US share a common stance on promoting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. China hopes the US and the international community could make joint efforts to solve the issue by negotiation," he said. 

"The US is trying to forge a political and military united front line against North Korea including having military drills with South Korea and calling on more countries to pressure North Korea," Song Zhongping, a TV commentator and military expert, told the Global Times on Friday.

Song said that the US may regard military clashes as the only way to force North Korea to give up developing nuclear weapons and it is rehearsing fast-moving tactics with its allies in case there is a war on the Korean Peninsula.

The US and South Korea will stage a joint air force drill, Vigilant Ace, from December 4 to 8, involving about 230 planes and 12,000 US personnel. The US plans to send six F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets to take part in the drill. B-1B strategic bombers and three or four F-35A jets will also likely join in, Yonhap reported. 

"The US is practicing accurate targeting capability against North Korea. B1-B strategic bombers will target any object from outside the defense area. An F-22 jet group would destroy a core target quickly, whether damaging missile bases or decapitating core leaders," Song said.

The US also asked the UN Security Council to call on all nations to cut all ties with North Korea, sever diplomatic relations, enforce UN sanctions and limit military, scientific, technical or commercial cooperation, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said during an urgent meeting of the Security Council, Euro News reported Wednesday.

Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday that the vicious circle on the Korean Peninsula has escalated as the US and its allies impose greater pressure on North Korea while the latter keeps on conducting missile tests, which heightens the possibility of military clashes. 

"The US and South Korea have set a bottom line for North Korea's nuclear missile tests - not having practical combat capability. But according to the current situation, it is just about time for North Korea to break through that line as it will not give up the ongoing tests," Lü said, adding that the Hwasong-15 has outperformed the Hwasong-14 in some areas such as launch height and distance.

Lee Eugene, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Ministry of Unification, told a press briefing on Friday that "the government does not think that North Korea's latest test demonstrated full capability for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] including the reentry technology and a precision guidance system. Seoul does not view the North as crossing the red line."

Before North Korea crosses the red line, the international community "still has time to solve the issue by diplomatic and peaceful means," said Lü, adding that "the US and its allies should seriously consider China and Russia's proposal for a double suspension.

The concept of a "non-market economy country" does not exist in the multilateral rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the surrogate country approach to calculating anti-dumping measures against China must be ended, a foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.

"In accordance with Article 15 of the accession protocol signed when China joined the WTO [in 2001], the surrogate country approach is required to be expired on December 11, 2016, which is definite and undoubted," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing on Friday.

"The expiration has nothing to do with the standard of market economy status that whether China has met or not," Geng said, noting that some countries and people are apparently confusing the public to avoid their own responsibilities.

"All the WTO members should keep their promise, comply with international rules and fulfill their obligations on international agreements," he said.

The comment came after the US President Donald Trump's administration formally rejected treating China as a market economy, a decision submitted to the WTO made public on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The decision filing marks the first time the US government has publicly declared its position, the report said.

"The decision shows the US is resorting to the rivalry game, a tactic different from the cooperation game embodied by Trump's visit to China, during which deals worth $253.5 billion were signed," Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.

Both the US and EU have broken their commitment to end the surrogate country practice to China last year. 

"If they continue to do so, their economic and trade relations with China will be affected due to the bad cooperation atmosphere," Bai said.

The reason the US and EU did not grant China market economy status was mainly due to the discrepancy between the standard they hold and China's economic system, Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. 

"Actually there is no strict definition of market economy standard in the WTO," Sang said. "The US and the EU also have their own standards on the concept, and different countries have their own market economy models, so there is not an applicable standard to the whole world."

"China should continue to deepen its economic reform and opening-up, to realize market economy status early, while on the other hand, it should urge the related parties to shoulder their responsibilities or resort to the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO," Sang said.

He also suggested the establishment of a regional center to address security challenges and threats, and to augment cooperation in drug control and fighting cross-border crimes. 

The SCO meeting is the first of its kind after the organization's membership expansion in June to include India and Pakistan.

The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), one of China's eight non-communist political parties, will elect a new leadership during its 12th National Congress, which opened here on Friday. 

Vice Premier Wang Yang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met congress delegates and delivered a congratulatory message to the association at the opening session on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. 

Over the past five years, the CAPD has performed its role in multi-party cooperation, said Wang, praising its contributions to promoting reform and opening and socialist modernization. 

The CPC will uphold and improve the system of CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation, he said. 

In handling its relationships with other political parties, the CPC will adhere to the principle of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, treating each other with sincerity and sharing of both good and bad times, according to Wang. 

Wang said the CPC will support these parties in performing their duties in line with the requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics for their participation in governance, and consolidate and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front. 

Wang appealed to the CAPD members to learn and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. 

CAPD chairwoman Yan Junqi delivered a report on the party's work over the past five years. 

Yan said the CAPD will study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, and carry out its duties as a participant party. 

She said the CAPD will contribute more wisdom to completing the building of a moderately prosperous society, the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. 

A new party central committee will be elected at the congress. 

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Friday congratulated the CAPD on the opening of its national congress. 

As a time-tested intimate partner with the CPC and one of the participating parties in building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, the CAPD has played an important role during the country's process of standing up, growing rich and becoming strong, says the congratulatory message. 

The CAPD is also an important force in securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, accomplishing Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, as well as realizing the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, says the message. 

The CAPD has provided valuable suggestions over the past five years on issues including the balanced development of compulsory education, to boosting the manufacturing industry via the reform of vocational education, and establishing a modern public cultural service system, the message says. 

The Central Committee of the CPC will continue to follow the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and insist on the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC, it continues. 

In the meantime, the CAPD is encouraged to follow major tasks raised at the 19th CPC National Congress and give full play to its strength in the development of education and the building of China into an innovative country. 

Founded in 1945, the CAPD membership mainly consists of intellectuals working in the fields of culture, education, publishing and science.

The possibilities of military clashes on the Korean Peninsula remain high as the US is trying to forge a united global political and military front to pressure North Korea, including sending its strongest planes to military drills with South Korea, Chinese experts said on Friday.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump on Thursday held their second phone talks in two days after Pyongyang's latest long-range missile test, agreeing to keep up the pressure and sanctions in hope of bringing the regime back to the negotiating table, the Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday.

"The two leaders agreed on the need to maintain their basic stance of putting strong sanctions and pressure on the North until North Korea voluntarily gives up developing nukes and missiles and comes out for dialogue," South Korea's presidential office Blue House said in a statement on Friday, Yonhap reported.

Chinese President Xi Jinping talked with Trump on the phone on Wednesday, saying the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China's unswerving goal, the Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily press briefing on Friday that China's stance on the North Korea nuclear issue is clear and has maintained communication with the US.

"China and the US share a common stance on promoting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. China hopes the US and the international community could make joint efforts to solve the issue by negotiation," he said. 

"The US is trying to forge a political and military united front line against North Korea including having military drills with South Korea and calling on more countries to pressure North Korea," Song Zhongping, a TV commentator and military expert, told the Global Times on Friday.

Song said that the US may regard military clashes as the only way to force North Korea to give up developing nuclear weapons and it is rehearsing fast-moving tactics with its allies in case there is a war on the Korean Peninsula.

The US and South Korea will stage a joint air force drill, Vigilant Ace, from December 4 to 8, involving about 230 planes and 12,000 US personnel. The US plans to send six F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets to take part in the drill. B-1B strategic bombers and three or four F-35A jets will also likely join in, Yonhap reported. 

"The US is practicing accurate targeting capability against North Korea. B1-B strategic bombers will target any object from outside the defense area. An F-22 jet group would destroy a core target quickly, whether damaging missile bases or decapitating core leaders," Song said.

The US also asked the UN Security Council to call on all nations to cut all ties with North Korea, sever diplomatic relations, enforce UN sanctions and limit military, scientific, technical or commercial cooperation, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said during an urgent meeting of the Security Council, Euro News reported Wednesday.

Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday that the vicious circle on the Korean Peninsula has escalated as the US and its allies impose greater pressure on North Korea while the latter keeps on conducting missile tests, which heightens the possibility of military clashes. 

"The US and South Korea have set a bottom line for North Korea's nuclear missile tests - not having practical combat capability. But according to the current situation, it is just about time for North Korea to break through that line as it will not give up the ongoing tests," Lü said, adding that the Hwasong-15 has outperformed the Hwasong-14 in some areas such as launch height and distance.

Lee Eugene, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Ministry of Unification, told a press briefing on Friday that "the government does not think that North Korea's latest test demonstrated full capability for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] including the reentry technology and a precision guidance system. Seoul does not view the North as crossing the red line."

Before North Korea crosses the red line, the international community "still has time to solve the issue by diplomatic and peaceful means," said Lü, adding that "the US and its allies should seriously consider China and Russia's proposal for a double suspension.

The concept of a "non-market economy country" does not exist in the multilateral rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the surrogate country approach to calculating anti-dumping measures against China must be ended, a foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.

"In accordance with Article 15 of the accession protocol signed when China joined the WTO [in 2001], the surrogate country approach is required to be expired on December 11, 2016, which is definite and undoubted," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing on Friday.

"The expiration has nothing to do with the standard of market economy status that whether China has met or not," Geng said, noting that some countries and people are apparently confusing the public to avoid their own responsibilities.

"All the WTO members should keep their promise, comply with international rules and fulfill their obligations on international agreements," he said.

The comment came after the US President Donald Trump's administration formally rejected treating China as a market economy, a decision submitted to the WTO made public on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The decision filing marks the first time the US government has publicly declared its position, the report said.

"The decision shows the US is resorting to the rivalry game, a tactic different from the cooperation game embodied by Trump's visit to China, during which deals worth $253.5 billion were signed," Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.

Both the US and EU have broken their commitment to end the surrogate country practice to China last year. 

"If they continue to do so, their economic and trade relations with China will be affected due to the bad cooperation atmosphere," Bai said.

The reason the US and EU did not grant China market economy status was mainly due to the discrepancy between the standard they hold and China's economic system, Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. 

"Actually there is no strict definition of market economy standard in the WTO," Sang said. "The US and the EU also have their own standards on the concept, and different countries have their own market economy models, so there is not an applicable standard to the whole world."

"China should continue to deepen its economic reform and opening-up, to realize market economy status early, while on the other hand, it should urge the related parties to shoulder their responsibilities or resort to the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO," Sang said.

China's tourism authority on Friday denied fining travel agents for organizing tours of the Vatican and Palau. 

The news was "untrue," the National Tourism Administration (NTA) said in a statement emailed to the Global Times on Friday. 

The denial came in response to a notice issued on November 20 by Nanjing-based website ctripc.com that two rival travel agents Tuniu and Tongcheng were fined more than 300,000 yuan ($45,562) for organizing group tours of the Vatican and Palau, a western Pacific archipelago country of over 500 islands in the Micronesia region.

Chinese travel agents are prohibited from organizing group tours to countries and regions not included on a list of 127 countries and regions, the NTA's statement said without elaborating further. The Vatican and Palau are not on the list.

In 2016, Beijing Municipal Commission for Tourism Development said that travel agencies are prohibited from doing business with nations not on the list.

The commission said it would fine or revoke the license of any agent that continued to sell the tour packages to the unlisted nations.

No tours to the Vatican or Palau can be found on the platform of the Comfort Travel Group, lvmama.com or the two other agents, the Global Times found on Friday.  

Ctripc.com is owned by the China Comfort Travel Group, one of China's largest travel agents.

Travel agents reached by the Global Times on November 23 said China's tourism departments have launched an investigation into autumn and winter travel packages.

Tensions escalated after North Korea launched a new Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the US mainland. The US is threatening extreme sanctions such as curbing oil supplies and is pushing for other countries to sever ties with Pyongyang. 

The pressure for the US to slap extreme sanctions on North Korea falls once again on China and the risk of war is rising. 

China will face difficult choices, but at least we can say China has tried its best. We can neither persuade Pyongyang nor sway the opinion of Washington. The only thing China can do next is to firmly uphold its principles, strive to alleviate tensions while at the same time preparing for the worst. 

China has done what it can for North Korea. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program caused geopolitical instability in Northeast Asia, increasing challenges to China's own security. The US found a new excuse to deploy its strategic military weapons to the region. The THAAD system poses a direct threat to China. 

China remains one of a few countries that still pursue a friendly policy toward North Korea. Although China participated in the UN Security Council sanctions, the country remains the largest trading partner of North Korea. China has in several UN Security Council debates strongly opposed a comprehensive trade embargo against Pyongyang, stressing that sanctions should only be geared toward fields related to the nuclear program but not to hurt ordinary North Korean people's livelihoods. 

China has done what it can for the US. The source of this nuclear crisis is the escalating hostility between Pyongyang and Washington. The theory that China should be held responsible is wrong in logic. To solve the nuclear crisis, one must work simultaneously on sanctions and negotiations. China has fulfilled its obligations in complying with UN Security Council sanctions, suffering a loss in Sino-North Korean relations. On the other hand, the US and South Korea failed to fulfill their obligations in alleviating tensions and pushing for talks. They have instead pinned their hopes on China. 

For a period of time, the US has been threatening China to increase sanctions against North Korea. Beijing has been working with Washington with the greatest patience possible. China has played a critical role in preventing the situation from collapsing into confrontation between the US and North Korea. With increasing US pressure on Pyongyang, China has suffered the greatest loss. 

When tensions on the Korean Peninsula reach a new height, a large portion of the pressure is transferred to China. But the US and North Korea must shoulder their own responsibility without making China the scapegoat. 

North Korea should be prepared to face further sanctions as it violated the UN Security Council resolutions to continue testing missiles. China has no reason to pay for North Korea's mistakes. 

Whatever North Korea did, it is wrong to impose a full trade embargo or to sever ties with the country. China has no obligation to cooperate with the US on this impractical idea. The US has no right to direct China or the UN Security Council. 

Recently the US media began to recognize China's efforts, acknowledging that China cannot stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. We believe that Pyongyang is beginning to recognize too that when it continues to test missiles and nuclear weapons, China cannot stop it from being punished.

The possibility of a war on the Korean Peninsula is rising and it is not decided by China. China's strategy should be maintaining its independent stance and principles, pushing the UN Security Council to craft the most reasonable policy and refusing to yield to either sides' extreme requests, be they from Washington or Pyongyang. 

China will face whatever comes next. Beijing is fully prepared to use its prowess to defend its national interest. China owes no one anything, and other countries must know this.
